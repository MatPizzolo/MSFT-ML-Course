# Diabetes Progression Analysis

## Description

This project involves creating a scatter plot with the BMI (Body Mass Index) on the x-axis and the quantitative measure of disease progression on the y-axis. This visualization can provide insights into the relationship between BMI and diabetes progression.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes dataset, which is a built-in dataset in Scikit-learn. It consists of ten baseline variables (age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements) and a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.
