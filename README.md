# Microsoft Machine Learning for Beginners Course Projects

Welcome to my repository for projects completed as part of the Microsoft ML for Beginners course. This repository contains implementations of machine learning algorithms and exercises covered in the course.

## Projects

1. [Project 1: Linear Regression](./1-Regression)
   - Description: This project involves creating a scatter plot with the BMI (Body Mass Index) on the x-axis and the quantitative measure of disease progression on the y-axis. This visualization can provide insights into the relationship between BMI and diabetes progression.
   - Dataset: The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes dataset, which is a built-in dataset in Scikit-learn.

2. [Project 2: Logistic Regression](./Project2_Logistic_Regression)
   - Description: -
   - Dataset: -

3. [Project 3: Decision Trees](./Project3_Decision_Trees)
   - Description: -
   - Dataset: -

## Getting Started
Each project folder contains its own README.md file with detailed information about the project, including objectives, datasets used, and instructions for running the code.
